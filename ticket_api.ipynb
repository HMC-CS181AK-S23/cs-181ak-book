        "\n",
        "Aftering learning how to code many new coders would love to know how they can use their new found knowledge to aid themselves and create new things. Luckily with the use of APIs people can use the data given to create programs that help them solve problems in their day to day lives. Although the ability to use API is important for programmers, it is not that easy to dive into. People often dive head first into using API without understanding what API is and how it works. An introductory tutorial to walk through how to use specific APIs would be a great and applicable way to learn how to use APIs in general.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why ticket-price-comparing software?\n",
        "\n",
        "As large gathers are becoming more safe again, many artists are going on tour. Yet, with the rise in ticket prices it can be a big hassle to find affordable tickets. Concert tickets can have various prices for the same concert, depending on which website you buy them from. Thus, in order to achieve the lowest price, users would have to cross-reference prices from various websites, which can take up their time and become tedious.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is this tutorial?\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial will help users learn how to build software that can compare different ticket prices automatically using APIs. Along with building useful software, this tutorial will also help users develop an understanding of APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial can largely be separated into three sections: general overview of API, getting familiar with using API, and making it a little more complex. The users will start by understanding what API is and how it works, play around and get comfortable with using it, and then build the ticket comparison function at the end."

        "### What is an API?\n",
        "The acronym “API” stands for “application programming interface.” But what does an API do?\n",
        "\n",
        "Think about your computer’s keyboard. When you type, you send data to the computer, and the computer responds by displaying the letter on the screen. You don’t have to mess with the inner workings of a computer to get a particular character to display – all you have to do is interact with the keyboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "An API works the same way, but with data – it should provide an intuitive interface for one digital system to send information to and from another digital system, without having to access the internal workings of either system.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### How does an API work?\n",
        "Developers request data from an API endpoint, and the set of rules that surrounds data transfer is called the HTTP protocol.\n",
        "\n",
        "In HTTP, you send a REQUEST through the API endpoint, along with certain parameters, in order to retrieve data from the applications. and there are many different types of methods for a REQUEST. The two most common REQUEST methods are GET and PUT: GET usually retrieves data from the API's appliation for the user to have, while PUT usually changes data within the application. There are also other methods such as POST, PATCH, and DELETE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once a REQUEST goes through, the API will do its thing, and then return a RESPONSE. The RESPONSE will contain a status code, content headers, and content data. Once this RESPONSE is received, the user can do whatever they want with the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your application can interact with many other applications simultaneously via APIs, since each application would have their own respective API with their own distinct functions. It's as if you were importing third-party libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### How will we use APIs?\n",
        "For this application, we will be interacting with Ticketmaster and SeatGeek APIs simultaneously to compare price tickets. First, we will guide you towards making REQUESTS from the Ticketmaster and SeatGeek APIs seperately, and then you will use what you've learned to retrieve prices from both websites and compare them.\n"
